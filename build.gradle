  println "The program takes two arguments. The first is either 'lazy' or 'triangle' to specify which sequence you would like to calculate. The triangle sequence is the additive version of a factorial. The lazy sequence is how many pieces you can get with x amount of cuts. The last argument is a 32 bit positive integer to calculate the sequence of that number. The program will exit if you input incorrect arguments."
